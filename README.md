# eventsourced
`eventsourced` is a project aimed at building an event sourcing library in Go. It is designed to be the default choice for building event sourced systems in Go, providing a robust, efficient, and easy-to-use solution for event sourcing needs.

# Next Steps Plan
- [ ] Watch Oskar Dudycz's talk on building an event store - https://youtu.be/gaoZdtQSOTo?si=5fGoIchkE48wZzoX
- [ ] Watch Alexey Zimarev webinar - You don't need an Event Sourcing framework. Or do you? - https://www.architecture-weekly.com/p/webinar-6-webinar-with-alexey-zimarev
- [ ] Research libraries in other languages, understand their strong points and weaknesses
- [ ] Analyze library from https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing and descope it to a minimal version
- [ ] Build MVP for MVP (something super simple) - using in-memory storage
